Nifty little scripts I wrote to make other things easier:
* pingsweep.py - Pings all the IP's in a range you provide and lets you know who answered.
* stringsplit.py - This script simply takes a big string and splits it into a bunch of smaller ones in the desired format
* binaryteacher.py - A script that converts binary to decimal and helps you visualize how that works
* passgen.py - A password generator written in Python.  Can combine random characters or random words.

Helpful things from courseware or other contributors:
* enumerateAD_services.ps1 - Powershell script from the OSCP courseware, helps find services on Windows
* adduser.bat - Adds a new user to a compromised Windows host for persistence, borrowed from Siddicky (Offsec Student Mentor)
* portscan.sh - A simple portscanner that uses bash (for situations where you can't use nmap)- just tells you open tcp ports.
