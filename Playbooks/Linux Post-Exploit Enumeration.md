# Local Postex
## Goal - get privesc

`whoami`

`sudo -l` - you can pretty much stop here if you're lucky

`ifconfig`

`ip -a`

`ss -antup`

`netstat -antup`

`lsof -i`

`cat /etc/*release`

`uname -a`

`arch`

`cat /proc/version`

`cat /etc/issue`

`cat /etc/profile`

`cat /etc/bashrc`

`cat /home/<user>/.bash_history`

`env`

`cat ~/.bashrc`

`cat ~/.bash_profile`

`cat /etc/passwd`

`cat /etc/shadow` (if able)

`grep -Rni password 2>/dev/null` and other juicy keywords

`ps aux` `ps aux | grep root` - what's running with privs?

`cat /etc/services`

`ls -lha /usr/bin`

`ls -lha /sbin/`

`dpkg -l` `rpm -qa` `ls -lha /var/cache/apt/archives0` `ls -lha /var/cache/yum` as applicable

`crontab -l`

`cat /etc/cron*` - anything writable running as root?

Configs: `cat /etc/syslog.conf` `cat /etc/apache/apache2.conf` `cat /etc/inetd.conf`

`cat /etc/exports` - hoping to see no_root_squash


# Root Postex
## Goal - get creds/loot and see if you can pivot anywhere
- Check /root directory
- Check user directories
- Screenshot of `whoami`, `ip a` and `cat proof.txt` if applicable

*Don't forget to prepend all these with `sudo` if you are not actually root*

`netstat -antup`

`ss - antup`

`cat /etc/shadow`

`cat /etc/passwd`

*save both of those files for unshadow/John later*

`cat /home/<user>/.bash_history` each user

`grep -Rni password 2>/dev/null` and other juicy keywords
